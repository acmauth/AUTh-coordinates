# What is this ? 
This his a JSON file that contains key locations all over the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki also known as AUTh. It is actively used by ACM AUTh's Student Companion app to display map data.  

# How to contribute 
Because AUTh is a large institution with multiple facilities it is normal for some to be forgotten and not be added in this JSON, please open a pull request to help us with documenting this sites. It is important to state that it is always crucial to keep the JSON object with the "name" of "Main AUTh Campus" at the bottom for reasons of compatabillity with the Student companion app. The PRs will be reviewed and be verified as legitimate AUTh location before being merged.
